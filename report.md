## Part 1: Agile Porject Management
**Project: Point-of-Sakle(POS) System**


**1. Agile Project Management**
This project adopts the **Agile software development methodology**, using the **Scrum framework** to manage the development of a small Point-of-Sale(POS) system. The system is developed iteratively and incrementally, allowing continuous feedback, collaboration, and improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

The Agile approach was chosen because it supports:
· Rapid delivery of functional components
· Continuous feedback and collaboration
· Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
· Improved team communication and transparency
· Early detection and resolution of issues
